> This project is one of my private personal project that I would like to show to DIO instructors to conclude my code challenge of SpringBoot in Santander BootCamp FullStack Challenge!

This project uses the WebFlux Architecture concepts and GraphQL to query the data. 
Just needs to map the entity but is working and needs to add SwaggerCodegen/Documentation.
- Finally, I will add Mapstruct for automatic mapping.
